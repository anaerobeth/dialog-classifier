Understanding Gender Terms,0
"A person's gender is one of the most basic parts of their identity. It is more than the sex assigned to them at birth. Gender is how a person feels and expresses themselves. It can influence, and be influenced, by many things. It can change over time.",0
Defining Basic Gender Terms,0
The following terms and definitions are commonly used to differentiate between various aspects of gender identity:,0
"Sex - The classification of people as male or female, typically assigned at birth based on the appearance of external anatomy.",0
Gender - The socially constructed roles and behaviors that a society typically associates with males and females.,0
"Gender identity - A person's internal sense of self, which can be male, female, both, neither or something else.",0
"Gender expression - How a person presents their gender to others through clothing, hairstyle, voice and mannerisms.",0
Cisgender - When a person's assigned sex at birth corresponds with their gender identity and expression.,0
"Gender nonconforming - When a person's gender expression does not correspond with the appearance or behaviors of a stereotypical male or female. Not all gender non-conforming people identity as transgender, and not all transgender people are gender non-conforming.",0
Agender - When a person doesn't have a specific gender identity.,0
Bigender - When a person has two gender identities.,0
"Genderqueer - When a person identifies with both genders, no gender or a combination of the stereotypical male and female characteristics.",0
Transgender - An umbrella term describing when a person's gender identity is different than what society expects based on the person's sex assigned at birth.,0
"Transgender woman - A person who was assigned male at birth, but identifies and expresses their gender as female. Sometimes shortened to trans woman.",0
"Transgender man - A person who was assigned female at birth, but identifies and expresses their gender as male. Sometimes shortened to trans man.",0
"Gender-expansive - When a person's identity or behavior is broader than the commonly held definitions of gender and gender expression in one or more aspects of their life. They may not identify with being either male or female, or may identify as a combination of both or they might express their gender in a different way.",0
"Gender-fluid - When a person has a flexible gender identity and expression that can fluctuate by the hour, day, or longer interval of time.",0
Gender dysphoria - An emotional and psychological condition experienced when a person's gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.,0
Gender confirmation surgery or sex reassignment surgery - A treatment for gender dysphoria which changes the physical appearance and function of a person's genitals to bring them into alignment with their gender identity.,0
"Intersex - A general term covering a variety of conditions in which a person's sex characteristics - including chromosomes, gonads or genitals - are not distinct to either a male or female.",0
Communication about gender can be clearer if the various terms are understood and correctly used.,0
"Writers who use unbiased language write in ways that are free from gender and group stereotypes including race, age, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation. By using unbiased language, writers can avoid using offensive language. This type of writing is appropriate for many different writing situations, especially in formal writing such as academic and journalistic. Writers must recognize where they are most likely to encounter problems of biased language in their writing.",0
Creating Unbiased Language,0
Gender Specific Pronouns and Sexist Terminology,0
"English speakers use gender specific pronouns to explain the gender of the person in question, as compared to other languages that use suffixes. The singular gender pronouns, he, she, him or her, are used in speaking and writing. In the past, the male pronouns were used to denote both male and female if the sentence used a singular construction.",0
Everyone must do his part.,1
"everyone. This means that any accompanying pronouns that refer back to everyone must be singular as well. In the past, the singular pronoun his",1
This type of singular gendered construction is no longer acceptable because it infringes on another issue of biased language called sexist terminology. Writers hesitate to use the masculine or the feminine versions of the pronoun.,0
"Instead, many writers will use the gender neutral pronouns such as they or their. This presents a grammar problem because the singular noun """" paired with a plural pronoun is grammatically incorrect. Sadly, this construction of the singular noun with a plural gender neutral pronoun is widely used in speech and has filtered into writing as well.
",0
Writers have two alternatives to fixing this problem.,0
"he or she or him or her construction. However, this could become very unwieldy very quickly. The constant use of he or she or him or her throughout a paragraph will get confusing to read, write or speak. Some writers like to use the term s/he. Again though, writers must consider how this construction sounds. How does someone pronounce s/he",1
"The second choice writers have is to use a plural noun with the plural non-gendered pronoun. This allows writers easy use of unbiased language compared to the first choice. In the first example, """" This avoids sexist language and a pronoun error.
",0
Sexist language is not confined to pronouns though. Another way to avoid gender roles and assumptions and used unbiased language is to use gender neutral endings on certain nouns. Job titles seem to carry a masculine construction that is now considered sexists and offensive.,0
The following list will give the example sexist language and how it can be changed to unbiased language:,0
Chairman could be chair person,0
Congressman could be member of congress,0
Postman or mailman could be postal worker,0
"Using unbiased language also means not assuming gender bias in roles that used to be predominantly male. For example, many people might assume that doctors or engineers are male because these occupations have traditionally been male dominated. Similarly nurses or teachers are not all women.",0
Groups of People,0
"When referring to groups of people in writing, writers must avoid using insulting terminology when referring to ethnicity, sexual preference, and disabilities.",0
"For ethnicity, writers must know what terms are appropriate and what terms are insulting. For instance, Asian is appropriate but Oriental would be considered insulting.",0
"For sexual preference, terms have been created to be specific and denote important distinctions rather than grouping people together. However, knowing which terms are in currently in favor compared with those that have gone out of favor will require the writer to do some research.",0
Ray has a mental disability says that the disability is a part of Ray is different than saying Ray is mentally disabled,1
Challenge of Unbiased Language,0
"Writing using unbiased language can be challenging because it requires an understanding of what constitutes biased language in the first place. Understanding how to use gender neutral language in a grammatically correct way, non sexist terminology, and non offensive terms for identifying groups of people will be a good place to begin.",0
"Antonyms, synonyms, and homonyms are three sources of concern in classrooms. They can be confusing, so it's good to get a hang of them early. These words can add a lot of variety to speech and writing. Once you understand how each is used, you will be able to overcome many challenges in spelling and vocabulary.",0
Interrelationship of Words,0
"When you're learning words, there can't help but be spots where things get a little murky. English vocabulary is especially full of pitfalls since the language is so vast. In English, there are several words that share one meaning or nuances of one meaning. Then there are tiny words like """" that have so many meanings that their definitions take up multiple dictionary pages. Then, just to make it more daunting, the English language has over a million words. As far as word banks go, English is massive.
",0
"But don't let the enormousness of the language turn you off. Homonyms, antonyms, and synonyms can be used to learn new words and add a great deal to your diction and the way you talk about language in particular.",0
"Knowing which words are similar or opposites helps people understand the same when it comes to ideas. Ideas are impossible without words, and words are impossible without ideas. The more you think about the interrelationship of one, the better you are able to think about the interrelationship of the other.",0
Antonyms,0
"Antonyms are words that mean the opposite of other words. They are used to show a contrast between two things. The antonym of """" for example. Some other examples of antonyms are full / empty, fail / succeed, and liquid / solid.
",0
The English language also lets its speakers make antonyms just by adding a prefix. The following are examples of how prefixes can be affixed to some words to create antonyms.,0
Un: Official becomes unofficial. Dress becomes undress.,0
In: Flexible becomes inflexible. Complete becomes incomplete.,0
Im: Possible becomes impossible. Polite becomes impolite.,0
Ir: Rational becomes irrational. Regular becomes irregular.,0
Dis: Honest becomes dishonest. Advantage becomes disadvantage.,0
Il: Logical becomes illogical. Legal becomes illegal.,0
Mis: Fortune becomes misfortune. Behave becomes misbehave.,0
"Keep in mind that adding a prefix does not always make the word an antonym. For example, flammable and inflammable are not opposites. They mean the same thing and are synonyms. There are always exceptions to the rules in the English language and some things just have to be learned through usage.",0
Synonyms,0
"Synonyms are words that share meanings with other words. They are used to add variety to writing and speech and allow you to avoid repetition. The words amazing, astounding, and marvelous are all synonyms. Their meanings are similar and can be interchanged with one another. Another set of synonyms are big, large, and huge.",0
There are many reasons why synonyms are great. Here are three:,0
"They make it possible for writers to create a certain mood with their subtle differences. """" The differences are implied by the word selected, and when a writer is trying to paint a picture in a reader's mind, those differences can make or break a writer's prose.
",0
"They give writers more rhythmic tools. """" but they are rhythmically very different. Every serious writer thinks about the rhythm of what he or she produces. Synonyms give writers more control over that rhythm.
",0
"They sound fancy. Sometimes knowing a better-sounding word makes you sound intelligent, like choosing """" but remember that a little of this goes a long way. If you don't want to use fancy synonyms, you should at least be able to know when someone else is. People may use argot that isn't immediately understandable, but if you know a lot of synonyms, you should never be lost. Plus, if someone fails to comprehend your own jargon, you can use a synonym they know to get your point across.
",0
"discharging a firearm instead of firing a gun, or disenfranchised youths for kids without voices.",1
Homonyms,0
"Homonyms are words that have the same spelling and pronunciation but different meanings. Because these words sound and look the same but mean something different they can be the source of entertainment, confusion, or even inspiration.",0
Some common homonyms:,0
Address can be a property location or it can be a manner of speaking to a group of people.,0
Bat can be an implement used to hit a ball or it can be a nocturnal flying mammal.,0
Bear can be an animal or it can mean to tolerate something or someone,0
Fire can mean a blaze or it can mean to terminate someone from a job.,0
Trip can mean to stumble or fall or it can mean to go on a vacation.,0
Watch can be a wearable timepiece or it can mean to look at something closely.,0
Expand Your Vocabulary,0
"Learning antonyms, synonyms and homonyms can be tricky but having a few in your language belt will certainly help expand your vocabulary. Using a variety of these words will make your speech and writing more vivid and exciting, and can help you avoid being repetitive or stale.",0
"How many times did you hear the phrase """" in English class? You thought you didn’t need it, but now you’ve sent an email to your coworker that was supposed to be professional but apparently came across as passive-aggressive, or texted a friend with congratulations that read dry and unfeeling, or sent an email to your boss about a project and used just one too many exclamation points.

Pick a topic and write about it until you fill up the page, not allowing yourself to second-guess the words you put down. Doing this every day will keep your mind used to expressing thoughts in writing, and eventually, you’ll find the sentence structures, words, and expressions that make your writing yours.",0
"If you’re trying to be more aware of your voice, try reading your emails and texts out loud before you send them. They should sound as natural to say as they do to read. This will take some practice—you may find that when you read your own writing out loud, it sounds stilted or you run out of breath trying to read long sentences. When you run across these situations, think about how you’d convey the same information if you were talking, and try to write it that way instead (minus the ums and ahs, of course).",0

"In the first sentence, Martin makes a declarative statement that ends in a period. The period goes inside the quotation marks. Treat anything within quotation marks as separate from the rest of the sentence you’ve written, and make sure it has its own correct punctuation. If the quote is a full sentence, it must begin with a capital letter, even though it is within the larger structure of another sentence.",0
"The second sentence begins a new paragraph because a different character is speaking. Fauntleroy responds with an outburst, ending with an exclamation mark. When an exclamation mark belongs to the sentence inside the quotation marks, it goes before the closing quotation mark.",0
"In the third sentence, Martin is making another declarative statement. This time, however, the statement is followed by the dialogue tag Martin replied. In dialogue, when a sentence that would normally end in a period is followed by a dialogue tag, the period becomes a comma. It should go before the closing quotation mark.",0
"In the fourth sentence, Fauntleroy’s query ends with a question mark. As with exclamation marks, a question mark goes before the closing quotation mark when it belongs to the sentence inside the quotation marks.",0
"In the fifth sentence, Martin is speaking, but there is no dialogue tag. Writers often omit dialogue tags when the context of a conversation makes it clear who the speaker is.",0
"In the sixth sentence, the dialogue tag Fauntleroy continued appears in the middle of Fauntleroy’s sentence. Notice the placement of the commas after And and continued; commas go before quotation marks. This sentence also contains a quote within a quote, which is enclosed with single quotation marks. Fauntleroy is repeating Martin’s words a few hours.",0

The Five Categories of Personality Traits,0
The field of psychology has given us the Five Factor Model (a.k.a. The Big Five). It breaks down personality traits into the following categories:,0
Openness,0
Conscientiousness,0
Extroversion,0
Agreeableness,0
Neuroticism,0
"This model has developed data-driven categories that explain the most basic personality traits. You'll notice it's rather broad and no one is enough of a cookie-cutter to merely exist within one category. Several subgroups do exist, but we'll focus on The Big Five here.",0
Openness,0
"People who display the openness trait are adventurous, imaginative, curious, open to new ideas, and perceptive. This category separates people who are imaginative from those who are more practical.",0
Open people tend to be appreciative of art and filled with wonder over the natural beauty that surrounds them. They're often travelers seeking new cultures and ideas to add to their own experiences. Scoring high on the openness scale indicates people who are more creative and able to express their emotions.,0
Scoring low on the scale generally indicates people who are more straightforward or traditional. People with low scores are generally uninterested in the arts and prefer simple solutions over more complex or inventive ones.,0
Other words to describe openness:,0
Accepting,0
Broad-minded,0
Daring,0
Insightful,0
Receptive,0
Tolerant,0
Conscientiousness,0
People who score high on the conscientiousness scale show great self-discipline and awareness of their responsibilities. They often have a very high regard for achievement and will use that as a means to measure themselves against others.,0
"This leads conscientious people to be very organized, academically prepared, and successful. In fact, after intelligence was factored, conscientiousness was found to be the most useful predictor of performance in the workplace out of any of the Big Five.",0
Low scores on the conscientiousness scale indicate people who are unorganized and seemingly unable to accomplish tasks. Low scores are also strongly connected with procrastination.,0
Other words to describe conscientious:,0
Dutiful,0
Exact,0
Faithful,0
Mindful,0
Steadfast,0
Truthful,0
Extroversion,0
"People who display extroversion traits tend to experience enthusiasm, self-confidence, and stimulation from other people's company. They're often full of energy and actively seek attention from others. Extroverts tend to be competitive and very involved in social circles.",0
"People low in extroversion are more likely to be introspective, reserved, and thoughtful.",0
Other words to describe extroversion:,0
Affable,0
Companionable,0
Convivial,0
Gregarious,0
Outgoing,0
Sociable,0
Agreeableness,0
"People who exhibit agreeableness show great compassion, cooperativeness, and empathy for others. They value being congenial and will go to great lengths to maintain their relationships.",0
Agreeable people have an optimistic view of human nature and believe people are generally honest and cooperative. This altruistic view on life can help them remain involved in various social causes.,0
People on the low end of the agreeableness spectrum tend to be blunt and rude.,0
Other words to describe agreeableness:,0
Congenial,0
Friendly,0
Good-natured,0
Gracious,0
Pleasant,0
Trusting,0
Neuroticism,0
"People who score high on the neuroticism scale are prone to being anxious, depressed, or angry. They're often easily disturbed or stressed by common situations that lead them to express a negative emotion.",0
This can lead people in this category to perceive normal interactions as threatening and trivial problems as impossible.,0
"People who score on the low end of neuroticism are more likely to be confident, brave, and adventurous.",0
Other words to describe neuroticism:,0
Agitated,0
Impatient,0
Jittery,0
Sensitive,0
Tense,0
Uneasy,0
Where Do You Fit In?,0
"Did you find that you belong to more than one of these categories? Since humans are complex beings, it's likely you don't fit into one generic area. However, you probably saw your traits more clearly in one group over another, right?",0

The examples above are just a selection, but maybe they'll help you discover more about yourself or develop one of the characters in your writing.",0

"In a day and age where everyone is stressed to the max, it's especially important to come up with the right words to thank volunteers. People who somehow find the time and energy to throw themselves into a cause can't be thanked enough! Even so, there are ways to let them know exactly how truly appreciated their time and efforts are.",0
Two Reasons to Show Appreciation,0
"The first reason you need to say thanks, obviously, is that it's simply the right thing to do. No one, no matter how dedicated they are to a cause or an issue, wants to feel that they're unimportant or that their hard work doesn't matter. Everyone needs to be appreciated, and it gives satisfaction to be told how important they are to whatever issue they are dedicating themselves to.",0
"The second reason is perhaps a little more cagey. That is, when you go out of your way to find the right words to thank volunteers, they will keep volunteering!",0
"It's extremely easy to find any number of reasons to avoid volunteering. Your job is to show your volunteers how appreciated they are, and what a good job they're doing, so they'll want to keep coming back.",0
Finding the Words to Thank Volunteers,0
"Like with most things, put yourself in their place. How would you want to be thanked? Would a one-time word of appreciation do it for you? Or would you want your good works to be noticed more regularly?",0
Of course it helps if your words are natural. No volunteer wants to think that the pat on the back is something someone had to work on doing!,0
"If it doesn't come naturally, and the words don't express gratitude in a normal human fashion, your volunteers will probably pick up on it. That kind of phoniness does no one any favors.",0
Words - Spoken Or Written,0
"That's up to you, but there's actually no reason why you can't do both! A regular word of kindness to volunteers for the job they do always is noticed and appreciated, especially when you say it right after they've done something wonderful.",0
"Say a volunteer works in a nursing home, helping elderly and sick people get some measure of happiness in their lives. If the volunteer stays late to cover another volunteer's shift, or if they take a special interest in the sadness of a widow on the anniversary of her dead husband's death, that's a measure of true kindness you can't buy for love or money.",0
"When someone goes out of their way, you should do the same to let them know how valued they are for what they do.",0
"On a holiday, or a birthday, or the anniversary of the volunteer joining your organization, it would be a good thing to write that person a note. You can use nice notepaper, or buy a card that expresses your sentiments.",0
How Should You Put It?,0
Thank you for all the good you do! We couldn't get along without you!,1
"Depending upon you or your organization's budget, you might also want to tuck a giftcard into the envelope.",0
"Not everyone who volunteers is wealthy. In fact, some volunteers could probably use someone to help them! The idea of providing a tangible memento of thanks for a selfless job well done is a kind and decent thing to do.",0
"It doesn't have to be a huge amount of money. A $10 giftcard to Starbucks or to a bookstore may be exactly the kind of treat your volunteer wouldn't spend on himself, but it might be the thing that would delight him nonetheless - and let him know that his efforts were truly and warmly appreciated.",0
"Never pass up a chance to find the words to thank volunteers. Being kind always brings a ton of rewards, to the giver and recipient alike!",0

When will Daddy come home?,1
"I rolled my eyes at the thought of having to answer this question for the millionth time. """" I offered in my most soothing tone.
",0
"But, he said he would be home for dinner, she wailed, and it's past dinnertime!",1
"In life, you'll learn there are many things that are out of our control, I retorted through the massive wails. I continued, almost to myself, But, we have to just carry on.",1
"When you choose to place your tag after the line of dialogue, the comma comes at the end of the spoken words, before the closing quotation marks. In this case, following the dialogue with a comma lets the reader know that there's more information to come. After the comma comes the quotation marks to end the dialogue, then a space, then the tag, followed by a closing period to complete the sentence. For example:",0
"We were having a lovely dinner,",1
"Yeah, until he showed up.",1
What's the matter with Scott coming around?,1
"Are you kidding me, Jill? He's a miserable, sarcastic punk.",1
"Well, yes, I said. I know that. But you two always carry on with him like you're best friends.",1
"Girl, please, Doug retorted. We thought you wanted us to keep the peace. Now that we know the misery he's caused you… He paused, seeming to search for the right words. He'll never walk through those two doors again.",1
"Note that the only exception to using a comma before the tag is when your quotation must end with a question mark or exclamation point. In this case, that punctuation replaces the comma:",0
How many days until our vacation?,1
Way too many!,1
Paragraph Examples,0
You must begin a new paragraph each time a different character begins to speak. Paragraphs are your friend for dialogue between two or more people. For example:,0
"I don't want to go home, said Julia. I like it here at the zoo. The animals are all so funny. She began to cry and then wailed, I didn't even get to see the elephants!",1
"I know, replied her father. Don't worry. We'll come back another time.",1
"The zoo is now closing. Please make your way to the exit,",1
"Note that, when Julia's father speaks, a new paragraph begins. Another paragraph is introduced when the announcer speaks. This makes it easier for the reader to keep track of who is saying what because the new paragraph is a strong signal that someone else is speaking.",0
"You must know I'm very upset, I snarled. I even paid extra to insure the package!",1
"Ms. Sullivan, please lower your voice, the agent drawled. I'll search the system now.",1
""""" I didn't know where the man appeared from, but I wanted to reach over the counter and give him a big, fat kiss. I'd never been so happy to see a cardboard box.
",0
"The only exception to this rule is when a character makes a long speech. In this case, you may wish to break up their dialogue into paragraphs as they change subject, just as you would in standard writing. When you do so, you begin each new paragraph with quotation marks to remind the reader that someone is still speaking, but you don't use closing quotation marks until the speech has ended.",0
For example:,0
"I want to make sure everyone is ready for the field trip next week, the teacher said. ",1
"""It will be hot the day of the trip, so wear light, comfortable clothing and layers that you can remove as the day goes on. You will also need sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses.",0
"Finally, make sure you have fun!",1
"In the example above, the teacher's long speech is broken into paragraphs to keep topics well organized. Notice that only the final paragraph of her speech has quotation marks at the end of the quoted text. When a paragraph of dialogue does not have closing quotes, it lets the reader know that the same person is still speaking.",0
Famous Examples From Literature,0
Let's take a moment to enjoy dialogue examples from some of the literary greats. No novel would be complete without an interesting volley between the main characters.,0
"A Wrinkle in Time, Madeleine L'Engel",0
"This is a great example. Watch L'Engel intertwine scene description with dialogue. Also, the main character, Meg, has dialogue written for her that continues with a tag in the middle.",0
Where are we going?,1
"Up. Charles continued his lecture. On Camazotz we are all happy because we are all alike. Differences create problems. You know that, don't you, dear sister?",1
""""" Meg said.

"""Oh, yes, you do. You've seen at home how true it is. You know that you're not happy at school. Because you're different.",0
"I'm different, and I'm happy,",1
But you pretend that you aren't different.,1
"I'm different, and I like being different.",1
"Maybe I don't like being different, Meg said, but I don't want to be like everybody else, either.",1
"Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte",0
"Here's a classic, straightforward block of dialogue.",0
"Now he is here, I exclaimed. For Heaven's sake, hurry down! Do be quick; and stay among the trees till he is fairly in.",1
"I must go, Cathy, said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from his companion's arms. I won't stray five yards from your window…",1
"For one hour,",1
"Not for one minute,",1
"I must--Linton will be up immediately,",1
"The Secret History, Donna Tartt",0
"Now, let's enjoy a block of dialogue that's blended beautifully with ample description for the scene at hand. We're instantly drawn in and then the dialogue picks up speed and lures us further into the story.",0
""""" she said, and spit out a mouthful of toothpaste. She was wearing cut-off jeans that had bizarre, frantic designs drawn on them in Magic Marker and a spandex top which revealed her intensely aerobicized midriff.

Speak Your Story,0
"Adding dialogue to a narrative can really bring the story and characters to life. Descriptive passages are great for setting the scene, but a few lines of dialogue can provide much more information about the characters.",0
"At first, formatting dialogue may seem tricky. However, you'll find it becomes second nature with practice. Once you learn the rules, you'll see that they apply in many situations, and it's only the words you change to make your writing interesting - never the formatting.",0
"The more you read books with dialogue and practice writing your own, the easier it'll be to write your own dialogue. For an in-depth dive on this skill, check out How to Punctuate Dialogue.",0
"Have you ever noticed how we sprinkle our everyday conversation with filler words? In truth, they add no meaning to our language but they can keep the conversation going. When it comes to writing, though, we need to be more aware of them.",0
"that. If you think about it, that can be removed from almost every sentence we write. Here's an example. She decided that she was going to be happy today. Wouldn't it be smoother and more concise to say, She decided she was going to be happy today",1
"As social and emotional beings, it's easy for us to tend toward the filler. Anything to get our point across, right? But, to be a prose master, you need to tighten up your writing by avoiding unnecessary filler words.",0

"We hope these examples will help you refine your writing process, too. We focused on some of the most obvious filler words that teachers and professors look out for. In truth, fillers aren't obvious until they're put on your radar. Once they are, it's game on! You'll almost never use that simply mundane expression ever again. Or, you'll never use that mundane expression again!",0
1) Write like you talk.,0
 Scene: Two friends meet on the street.,0
"Hello, John. How are you?",1
"I am just fine. And how are you, Martha?",1
Thank you for asking. I am fine. How's your job search coming along.,1
"My job search is going rather slowly, I'm afraid. Are you still working at Smith and Sons?",1
"Wasn't that painful to read? The characters are lifeless. You would never speak in that manner in real life, so please don't ever have your characters do it.",0
Here's a more likely scenario:,0
"Hey, John, what's up?",1
"Not much, you?",1
Same old. You still out job hunting?,1
"Yeah, sorry to say. You still at Smith & Sons?",1
Now add some filler (deeper POV):,0
""""" Martha's attempted smile never reached her pretty green eyes. She bit her bottom lip.
",0
"John considered his friend for a moment then heaved the heavy backpack off his shoulders. It hit the ground with a thud. """"
",0
Same old. Martha's voice was so low he had to step closer to hear. You still out job hunting?,1
"Yeah, sorry to say. He gently lifted her chin to peer into her face. Tears were about to spill there. He felt the pull of her chin as she tried to turn away. You still at Smith and Sons or did something happen?",1
"Now we have two living, breathing characters.",0
2) Make it realistic. People often cut each other off.,0
Did you put gas in the car like I asked –- ,1
"Of course. Don't I always,",1
in his voice.,0
"I know, but tonight –-",1
I don't want a lecture.,1
"3) Get to the point. Make if flow, but stick to the subject. In real life we tend to ramble, stop in the middle and start a new subject, or just not talk in complete sentences. This doesn't work well in novel dialogue. Limit the uhs and ums.",0
"Frank bought me the cutest card the other – oh, that reminds me, we need to order the flowers. Did Jennifer RSVP by the way?",1
"Although this was an actual conversation I overheard at lunch, it's too confusing and thrown together for a novel.",0
4) We speak differently with different people. What you say to your sweetie won't work with the boss. Keep your dialogue genuine to the situation. A man softens his voice when speaking on the phone to his girlfriend. A woman speaks louder and acts more brazen with 'the girls' than with her mother.,0
"5) More body language, less words. Showing instead of telling creates deeper POV and makes the scene more interesting. As we are speaking, remember we are also doing something; moving around, drinking coffee, picking lint off our clothes. You're not just standing there staring at the speaker.",0
Sometimes you don't need any dialogue to convey the message:,0
"I'm quite aggravated,",1
"OR: She crossed her arms tightly over her chest, tilted one hip, and gave him a raised eyebrow.",0
"6) Keep your character's dialogue in sync with their personality. A nun probably wouldn't curse. A guy in prison wouldn't call PJs jammies. Be true to your character in word, tone and mannerism. A painfully shy man doesn't suddenly become a ladies man.",0
"7) Accents and foreign language. If your character is foreign and has an accent, give the reader a few words in his/her language, but don't overwhelm with thick accents that are hard to understand or tons of foreign words that have to be looked up. The unwritten rule is if you must use the accent/language then limit it to two or three words per page. Git me drift, luv? All good, dahlin'? Och, lassie, ye ken? Ya mus can do dat ting, yah?",0
8) Don't over inform. When people talk they generally know each other. A person would never say:,0
"Tom, my old friend from grad school, it's so good to see you away from your three-bedroom condo on the ocean where you live with your two poodle dogs, Bridget and Sparky.",1
Never use dialogue as a filler or to increase your word count. Make it relevant to the story. Only use dialogue to move the scene along. Cut any useless conversations. They slow down the pacing.,0
"9) Dialogue tags. Nothing is worse than a long unending conversation where you have to go back and figure out who is saying what. Tags are not needed after every line though. An occasional 'he said' will do the trick and actually gets ignored by the reader and will not interrupt the flow. Characters say their lines. They don’t cluck, snort, shout, retort, purr, snigger, interject or bark. (By the way, those are all 'telling' not 'showing'.) If the couple is having a fight, the dialogue can be a quick back and forth.",0
"I never wanted to go out with you in the first place,",1
"But you did,",1
"Only because you were so pathetic,",1
"I only seemed pathetic because you were such a brat,",1
A brat? You're calling me a brat?,1
"I call as I see 'em,",1
"Oh, yeah, well see this,",1
"See how all those tags get annoying? If you removed all the tags except the first one, you could still follow along easily. But, as this is a fight, a few POV fillers would fill out the piece nicely. Notice how I didn't always begin with the dialogue.",0
"I never wanted to go out with you in the first place,",1
"His face began to darken with anger. """"
",0
Only because you were so pathetic.,1
I only seemed pathetic because you were such a brat.,1
A brat? You're calling me a brat?,1
I call as I see 'em.,1
"Oh, yeah, well see this,",1
"10) Men versus women. A female writer will often write the way she herself speaks, which will not work on a male character. Men and women think and talk differently. Men speak in shorter, clipped sentences. A man would never describe the pink color as salmon or peach. Men are more visual and prone to action; women have a better sense of taste and smell, and tend to analyze.",0
"Punctuating dialogue can be a bit tricky at times. If it's not learned right at an early age, it can be tough to rectify - but not impossible. Commas are one of the largest considerations when wondering how to punctuate dialogue. After that, it's important to pay attention to the terminal marks, or the punctuation that closes the dialogue, including periods, questions marks, and exclamation marks. Let's break it all down.",0
When Is Punctuation Required?,0
"The first thing to note is that quotation marks are only required in direct dialogue. If you're quoting someone's exact words, get ready to wrap their sentiments in quotation marks.",0
Direct Dialogue,0
"Consider these two examples with tags, which refer to the """" type indicators of direct speech.
",0
I wake with the morning sun every day.,1
"When a tag comes first, you need to place a comma after """" and before you open the quotation marks. Also, be sure to place the closing punctuation mark (whether that's a period, question mark, or exclamation mark) within the quotation marks if it is a part of the direct quote.
",0
"I wake with the morning sun every day,",1
"When the tag comes last, you'll need to place a comma inside the quotation marks and then finish the line normally. If the quoted text ends with a question mark or exclamation mark, the comma is not needed.",0
"In both instances, whether the tag comes first or last, the first letter of the first word in the quote should generally be capitalized. The exception would be if the quote is integrated into the sentence itself without a tag.",0
with the morning sun every day.,1
Indirect Dialogue,0
"Sometimes, we also come across indirect dialogue. Those are instances when we're loosely reporting what someone said without providing an exact quote.",0
Indirect Dialogue: He told me he wakes with the morning sun every day.,0
"You'll notice that no quotation marks are used, and the sentence is punctuated normally.",0
How to Use Dialogue Tags,0
"When we're reading our favorite novels, sometimes there are no dialogue tags. That is, the author doesn't need to include """" before or after every bit of dialogue. We might read a passage from a book that goes something like this:
",0
I never want to see you again!,1
"Mi amor, what can I do to make you stay?",1
Nothing! You've broken my heart well and good now.,1
"But, you know I never meant you any harm.",1
"Get out of my way, Roberto, before I push you out that door.",1
"Wait, he whispered, as she pushed past him. At least let me give you this before you walk out of my life.",1
"Once we're into the rhythm of a scene like that, dialogue tags are no longer required. It's easy to follow the action. Part of the reason it's easy to follow is because each new speaker is given a new paragraph break. So, every time you're changing speakers in a manner that doesn't require a new dialogue tag, be sure to create a new paragraph break.",0
"Even when dialogue tags are required, there are many ways to place them into the line of text. The most basic example is:",0
"I don't love you anymore,",1
"But, sometimes, dialogue gets interrupted by the need for a tag. Here's an example of that:",0
"I don't love you anymore, she said, hoping to cut through his heart, but you can rest assured I'll never forget you.",1
OR,0
"I don't love you anymore, she said, hoping to cut through his heart. But, you can rest assured I'll never forget you.",1
"I don't love you anymore, but you can rest assured I'll never forget you. In the second example, the tag is placed between two separate sentences. I don't love you anymore. But, you can rest assured I'll never forget you.",1
The writer might also need to make an important note about the scene as the dialogue is unfolding.,0
Let's look at another example:,0
"I don't love you anymore, she said as she tossed the drink in his face, but you can rest assured I'll never forget you.",1
Other Forms of Punctuation,0
"So, now we know that, after """" we need to place a comma before opening up the quotation marks.
",0
You look lovely in that shade of green.,1
"We also know that terminal punctuation (like periods, question marks, or quotation marks) must be placed within quotation marks when closing out a sentence. Finally, if the dialogue tag is placed after the line of dialogue, a comma is required because the sentence is continuing on.",0
"That's so kind,",1
But what about other forms of punctuation as they relate to dialogue?,0
Ellipses,0
Ellipses are a great way for writers to dramatize a scene. Let's look at an example:,0
"Clearly, he caught her off-guard. Immediately, he asked her what she was doing in this room.",0
I'm umm… I'm just…,1
You're what?,1
"I'm just looking for Anabelle's stuffed rabbit, she concluded. She lost it earlier this afternoon.",1
"You could probably sense the woman's panic at being caught snooping around in his room. Ellipses indicate awkward or extended pauses, building anticipation. A comma is not needed following an ellipsis.",0
Dashes,0
"Ellipses create a certain sense of drama. Dashes can do the same. Typically, they're used to create a sense of urgency. Maybe one speaker is cutting off the other to get right to the point. Here's an example:",0
Help! I've looked everywhere for my new fountain pen and I can't find it! I think maybe Robbie-,1
"You think maybe Robbie, what, stole it?",1
No! I didn't say that. I think maybe he-,1
"He what, Melissa? Get to the point!",1
I think maybe he broke it and doesn't want to tell me.,1
"In a similar way, dashes can create a sense of drama, just like ellipses. But, here's the most important difference between these unique forms of punctuations: Ellipses and dashes don't require a period within the quotation marks.",0
"So, let's look at this Robbie example. You wouldn't write this:",0
Help! I've looked everywhere for my new fountain pen and I can't find it! I think maybe Robbie-.,1
"You don't need a period for these special marks because you're not ending the sentence. Rather, you're very deliberately expressing that the thought wasn't complete.",0
Paragraph Blocks,0
Have you ever read a novel with a long excerpt of dialogue? It might've read something like this:,0
"Joan enthusiastically exclaimed, ""Oh, you simply must visit Ireland at some point in your life!",0
"""You'll find the people are genuinely nice and eager to help. Very rare is it for you to meet someone looking to cop an attitude with you.",0
"""The lush greenery is show-stopping. The land seems to just blend into the horizon.",0
"And, where else can you go to find 10th-century ruins down the road from a brand new shopping center?",1
"What's important to note here is that, when dialogue spills over into more than one paragraph (e.g., where a single speaker continues over two or more paragraphs), you don't need to close the quotation marks until they're finished speaking. However, each new paragraph still needs to have an opening quotation mark.",0
Punctuation Outside Quotation Marks,0
"More often than not, when you see a terminal mark placed outside the closing quotation mark, it's been written in error. However, there are certain instances where it's grammatically correct. For example:",0
She deserved it,1
"These punctuation marks are placed outside the closing quotation marks because the punctuation applies to the entire sentence. In other words, Joseph isn't the one who asked the question; the sentence itself as a whole is a question.",0
Punctuation Perfection,0
"What's great about dialogue is that, once you have its punctuation down pat, you're well on your way to being a grammar pro. Dialogue is one of the trickier elements. But, the more you practice it, the more it becomes second nature, just like any other form of writing.",0
"To make sure you're in tip-top shape, be sure to review these 11 rules of grammar.",0
