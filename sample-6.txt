"I wasn’t planning on going anywhere—"
"I can see that. Where’s your coat?"
"I left the house in a hurry. I… um… my mother…"
"The hospital reached you? God, I’m sorry. That’s why—"
"The hospital?"
"They called me when they couldn’t get you."

"Oh. Oh, God. Mom’s all right, isn’t she? Oh, Christ, she isn’t. I’m being punished… she’s dead."
